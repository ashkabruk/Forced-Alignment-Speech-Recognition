Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on
achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of
the American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward
our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated
state. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of
August. We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.
Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy
restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point.
